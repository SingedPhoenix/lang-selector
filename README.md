# Programming Language Survey
## by Daniel Aberle

### Programming Languages and Software Used
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
JavaScript
jQuery
Adobe Photoshop

### Description
I created a programming language survey whose function is to make the decision of which programming language to learn less of a burden on coders who are yearning for learning.

For the code, I used jQuery with the .show() and .hide() methods to reveal divs of HTML I authored. I was even able to add in an else conditional that will warn the user if they didn't fill out the survey completely.

I had no major issues, just a minor issue with mislabeling variables...other than that, pretty simple fare.

### Detailed Instructions
The survey itself is pretty self-explanatory...I mean, it's not a "cool" Facebook survey to find out what piece of furniture you'd be if you could be a piece of furniture...

Because I couldn't possibly code out all of the variations of answers, I created an answer key to show you the functionality of the program.

To get React, try this survey answer combination:
_Windows / Yes / Love / Facebook / Blue_

_Mac / Yes / Love / Facebook / Blue_

_Mac / Yes / Love / Facebook / Purple_


To get Ruby, try this survey answer combination:
_Mac / Yes / Love / AirBnB / Red_

_Mac / Yes / Hate / AirBnB / Red_

_Windows / Yes / Hate / AirBnB / Red_


To get C#, try this survey answer combination:
_Windows / No / Hate / Mircosoft / Purple_

_Windows / No / Love / Microsoft / Purple_

_Mac / No / Hate / Microsoft / Purple_
